# Hangman
Created a game of Hangman using Python and Turtle graphics that generates a random word from a list of 10k words, and if not guessed correctly, then allows the player six incorrect guesses while excluding repeats before the game reveals the word and restarts.
In the future, I hope to implement a feature built for two players that allows them to choose their own word to guess or even have them compete against each other. 
To use, download the .py file and run the module in an IDE like PyCharm.
